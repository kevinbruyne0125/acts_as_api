== DESCRIPTION:

acts_as_api makes creating XML/JSON responses in Rails 3 easy and fun.

== FEATURES:

The built-in XML/JSON support of Rails is great but:

You surely don't want to expose your models always with all attributes.

acts_as_api enriches the models and controllers of your app in a rails-like way so
you can easily determine how your API responses should look like.

== SYNOPSIS:

Say you have a model +Customer+ and every customer +has many :orders+.

If you only want to expose the +firstname+ and +lastname+ attribute of a customer
via the api, you would do something like this:

<pre><code>
class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :orders

  # let this model act as api!
  acts_as_api

  # define the accessible attributes/methods for the api response
  api_accessible :firstname, :lastname

end
</code></pre>
