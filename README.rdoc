== DESCRIPTION:

acts_as_api makes creating XML/JSON responses in Rails 3 easy and fun.

== FEATURES:

The built-in XML/JSON support of Rails is great but:

You surely don't want to expose your models always with all attributes.

acts_as_api enriches the models and controllers of your app in a rails-like way so
you can easily determine how your API responses should look like.

acts_as_api uses the *default Rails serializers* for XML and JSON, so you don't have to
mess around with even more dependencies. Once you change the serializers for your Rails app,
they will be changed for acts_as_api too.

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Set up your model

Say you have a model +Customer+ and every customer has many +:orders+.

If you only want to expose the +firstname+ and +lastname+ attribute of a customer
via the api, you would do something like this:


  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base

    has_many :orders

    # let this model act as api!
    acts_as_api

    # define the accessible attributes/methods for the api response
    api_accessible :firstname, :lastname

  end

=== Set up controller

Now you just have to exchange the +render+ method in your controller for the +render_for_api+ method.

  class CustomersController < ApplicationController

    def show
      @customer = Customer.find(params[:id])

      respond_to do |format|
        format.html # show.html.erb
        format.xml   { render_for_api :xml  => @customer }
        format.json  { render_for_api :json => @customer }
      end
    end

  end

=== That's it!

Try it. The response should now look like this:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <customer>
    <firstname>John</firstname>
    <lastname>Doe</lastname>
  </customer>

Other attributes of the model like +created_at+ or +updated_at+ won't be included because they were
not listed by +api_accessible+ in the model.

=== What can I include in my responses?

You can do basically anything:

* Include attributes and all other kinds of methods of your model
* Include child associations (if they also act_as_api this will be considered)
* Call methods of a parent association
* Rename attributes, methods, associations
* Create your own hierarchies

Here are two models from the example app that show how it works.

The model +Customer+ shows all kinds of ways to add data to your API response.

  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base

    has_many :orders

    # let this model act as api!
    acts_as_api

    # define the accessible attributes/methods for the api response
    # some attributes of the model
    api_accessible :firstname, :lastname, :age,
      # you can include methods
      :full_name,
      # include associated model in response
      :orders,
      # rename the key for orders
      :renamed_orders => :orders,
      # put orders in another subnode
      :subnode_orders =>  { :sub_oders => :orders },
      # rename nodes/tag names
      :other_node => :say_something,
      # create a deeper node hierarchy
      :maybe => { :useful => { :for => :say_something } }

    # some example methods
    def full_name
      '' << firstname.to_s << ' ' << lastname.to_s
    end

    def say_something
      "something"
    end

  end

The model +Order+ also acts as api and is even able to access a method of their parent customer.

  class Order < ActiveRecord::Base

    belongs_to :customer

    # let this model act as api!
    acts_as_api

    # define the accessible attributes/methods for the api response
    # some attributes of the model
    api_accessible :city, :amount,
    #access a method of the parent association
      :parent_name => "customer.full_name"

  end
